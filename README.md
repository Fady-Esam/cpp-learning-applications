# 📘 C++ Learning & Applications

  A collection of C++ solutions and projects built during my journey of mastering the basics of C++, core programming principles, and computer science fundamentals. <br>
  Each folder highlights a key concept such as OOP, data structures, File Handling, Pointers, Vectors and more through applied, problem-solving implementations and interactive examples.

## 🧠 What I Learned & Applied

- 📌 **Basics**  
→ Variables, Data Types, Operators, Input/Output, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Arrays, and Strings

- 🎯 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  → Classes, Structs, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Constructors/Destructors

- 🧩 **Data Structures**  
  → Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees (basics), and their implementations from scratch

- 💡 **Pointers & Memory Management**  
  → Pointer basics, pointer arithmetic, pointer to array, dynamic memory

- 📂 **Vectors (STL)**  
  → Dynamic arrays, common vector operations, iterations

- 📁 **File Handling**  
  → Reading from and writing to text files using `fstream`, processing line-by-line input/output

- 💻 **Problem Solving Practice**  
  → Projects, exercises, and algorithmic problems focused on logic and real-world scenarios
